INFO_CACHEABLE =  A second-level cache helps improve performance by avoiding expensive database calls, keeping the entity data local to the application. A second-level cache is typically transparent to the application, as it is managed by the persistence provider and underlies the persistence context of an application. That is, the application reads and commits data through the normal entity manager operations without knowing about the cache.
INFO_NATIVE_QUERY = Define a database specific query feature or highly optimized query that can not be transformed into JPQL.
INFO_ENTITY_GRAPH = An entity graph is a query independent template that captures the path and boundaries for an operation or query.
INFO_JPQL_QUERY = Define a static named jpql query that is compiled and validated by the persistence provider at start-up time.
INFO_STORED_PROCEDURE_QUERY = Define a stored procedures query to call stored procedure that implement parts of the application logic in the database.
INFO_RESULTSET_MAPPING = Define a custom mapping between the columns of the query result (native SQL query or stored procedure) and the properties of an entity.
INFO_EXTENDS_CLASS = An entity can have a non-entity superclass, which may be either a concrete or abstract class. he state of non-entity superclasses is nonpersistent, and any state inherited from the non-entity superclass by an entity class is nonpersistent. Non-entity superclasses may not be used in EntityManager or Query operations. Any mapping or relationship annotations in non-entity superclasses are ignored.
INFO_COVERTER = Converter allows the developer to specify methods to convert between the database and the Java representation of an attribute.
